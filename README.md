# The Good Ones

Today it is hard to find some good ones. Because everyone had their opinions 
(and opinions are often like noses) how to develop software.

A collection of the good ones. 

A try to collect the good stuff I found over past the years (since 2000)

I believe that good product could not be mass product.

Good vegetables you will find on a small vegetables market of farmers.

## Programming Languages

### Oberon 2

- Oberon Compilers and Language reference material [http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/compiler](http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/compiler/index.html#report)

### Arc

Arc is Lisp. Paul Graham tried to get back in time and make a fresh start.

Lisp basically work with 7 primitives. Basic building stones:

1. car  
2. cdr
3. cons
4. atom
5. quote
6. eq
7. cond

The rest of the language can be written in the language itself by using this stones.
I call it the [Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego) principle. 
The 7 primitives of Lisp remembers me on a set of basic bricks in Lego. 

Graham added 3 new primitives to the core:

8. rep
9. tag
10. type

For instance with tag it is possible to "tag" a function as macro and use this 
information in eval to do a macex.

## Operation Systems

### Oberon

It is a small elegant operating system. It was ahead of his time and still is.

### Minix

Minix has a small stable kernel. 

A kernel is like the heart of the body it should never stop working.

The kernel could be overseen by one person.

Minix drivers for instance run like programms. If a driver crash, the driver will be restarted.

### BeOS / Haiku OS

Haiku OS is the open source project of BeOS. Build on NewOS Kernel.

## User Interface

### The Humane Interface

The ideas is this book are still ahead of time and will be. All current interface could not
changed because it would cause to make a fresh start. That no big company will do.

- The Humane User Interface Book in Wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface)

## Others

The basic idea of this book is to think in patterns. Keep thing simples and bring you code in order.
The humane brain for instance is a rule (pattern) extraction machine. Kids learn a language by
extract the pattern of the language by listen all day long to the parents.
