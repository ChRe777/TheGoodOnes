# The Good Ones

Today it is hard to find some good ones. Because everyone had their opinions 
(and opinions are often like noses) how to develop software.

A collection of the good ones. 

A try to collect the good stuff I found over past the years (since 2000)

I believe that good product could not be mass product.

Good vegetables you will find on a small vegetables market of farmers.

I believe in the lego principe And keep it simple. 
Most projects I saw with high level of complexity. 
That means you have no simple lego stones, but very complex one.

## Design

Design a software like building a house. First you need to know what to build.
Make a plan and build if up layer by layer. Do not build the house from the roof.
But always have the overview of the end result. Most do not know the end result, build something and change it and change it.
If you change to often you get in a total mess which needs a lot of energy to keep it alive.

## APIs

I believe that it much better not to be bride and get a hacker, but rather look
at good apis and look how they made it then to create your own one's.

### Maya API

### MSDN - Examples lead to Bad Code

I believe that the examples in MSDN leads to bad programer pratice we all face of our colleagues.
If a example writer writes an example of for instance loading something from the db and
put into a dataview. He leads people to do this is production code. 
The purpose was to give a simple example. But in reality you should not do that.

## Programming Languages

### Oberon 2

- Oberon Compilers and Language reference material [http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/compiler](http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/compiler/index.html#report)

### Arc

Arc is Lisp. Paul Graham tried to get back in time and make a fresh start.

Lisp basically work with 7 primitives. Basic building stones:

1. car  
2. cdr
3. cons
4. atom
5. quote
6. eq
7. cond

The rest of the language can be written in the language itself by using this stones.
I call it the [Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego) principle. 
The 7 primitives of Lisp remembers me on a set of basic bricks in Lego. 

Graham added 3 new primitives to the core:

8. rep
9. tag
10. type

For instance with tag it is possible to "tag" a function as macro and use this 
information in eval to do a macex.

## Operation Systems

### Oberon

It is a small elegant operating system. It was ahead of his time and still is.

### Minix

Minix has a small stable kernel. 

A kernel is like the heart of the body it should never stop working.

The kernel could be overseen by one person.

Minix drivers for instance run like programms. If a driver crash, the driver will be restarted.

### BeOS / Haiku OS

Haiku OS is the open source project of BeOS. Build on NewOS Kernel.

## User Interface

### The Humane Interface

The ideas is this book are still ahead of time and will be. All current interface could not
changed because it would cause to make a fresh start. That no big company will do.

- The Humane User Interface Book in Wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface)

## Others

The basic idea of this book is to think in patterns. Keep thing simples and bring you code in order.
The humane brain for instance is a rule (pattern) extraction machine. Kids learn a language by
extract the pattern of the language by listen all day long to the parents.
