# TheGoodOnes

A collection of the good ones. A try to collect the good stuff I found over the years.

I believe that good product could not be mass product.

Good vegetables you will find on a small vegetables market of farmers.

## Programming Languages

### Oberon 2

- Oberon Compilers and Language reference material [http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/compiler](http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/compiler/index.html#report)

### Arc

Arc is Lisp. Paul Graham tried to get back in time and make a fresh start.

Lisp basically work with seven primitives. Basic building stone:

1. car  
2. cdr
3. cons
4. atom
5. quote
6. eq
7. cond

The rest of the language can be written in the language itself.

Graham added two new primitives to the core:

8. rep
9. tag

With tag it is possible to "tag" a function as macro.

### Minix

Minix has a small stable kernel. The kernel could be overseen by one person.
Minix drivers for insance run like programms. If a driver crash, the driver will be restarted.
